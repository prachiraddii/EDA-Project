# 🧪 Exploratory Data Analysis on Diabetes Dataset

This project demonstrates a complete Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) workflow on a diabetes dataset using **Python**, **Pandas**, **NumPy**, and **scikit-learn**. The lab is part of CognitiveClass.ai's learning path.

## 🎯 Objectives

After completing this EDA project, the following skills were demonstrated:

- ✅ Performed EDA using a set of simple and easy-to-remember Python commands
- ✅ Interpreted key EDA plots and descriptive statistics
- ✅ Improved prediction model readiness using insights gained from EDA
- ✅ Performed basic feature engineering (e.g., one-hot encoding)
- ✅ Detected and handled outliers
- ✅ Dealt with missing data efficiently
