# ðŸ§ª Exploratory Data Analysis on Diabetes Dataset

This project explores the Diabetes dataset using **Pandas**, **NumPy**, and **OneHotEncoder** from **Scikit-learn**. The goal is to understand the data through summary statistics, visualization, and prepare it for future machine learning models.

## ðŸ“Œ Objectives

- Perform data cleaning and inspection
- Use one-hot encoding for categorical features (`sex`)
- Analyze feature distributions and relationships
- Prepare data for machine learning

## ðŸ“‚ Files

- `EDA_lab.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with full analysis
- `requirements.txt`: List of libraries used

## ðŸ“Š Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (optional if used)

## âœ… Sample Output

The `sex` column was one-hot encoded into `sex1` and `sex2` to eliminate implicit ordinal meaning. Here's a sample output from the notebook:
